      <b>Story</b><br><br>
      When I arrived here, I rarely drank alcohol. Socially, sometimes, but I always turned down invitations to bars as I had other interests to focus on.
One of those interests was a girl. She liked me, we dated, and everything was nearly perfect; the only problem was school assignments and studying getting in the way of spending more time together (or choosing poor grades instead). But the summer holidays would arrive soon, and nothing would get our the way.
We broke up just before the summer holidays began.
And now, I've become the strongest drinker of the class.

If you want to know the best place to drink for any given hour of the day, use the contact me form on the right!
